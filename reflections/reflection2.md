## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

This week, we were tasked with many challenging things which included the implementation of the cart, merch page, buying of the movies and starting the post in each genre. After diligently working throughout this week, we successfully complete the cart functionality, which included buying both the merch and movies and the post functionality in each genre page. The genre page will show all the created posts associated with that genre. 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

This week our biggest challenge was connecting the cart items to the orders page. This feature still has few bugs as we are still unable to put the purchased movies from the cart into the orders page,

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Surprisingly, we completed all of the sprint task we set for ourselves this week and even a few stretch features (at least for this week)  which included having the purchase button from the individual movie page send the movie information to the cart.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Like last week we found many resources like the lab, YouTube, and stackoverflow to be extremely useful in decoding bugs and giving us ideas on the best ways to get things started when implementing features we might not have coded before.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 A feature that we would consider "at risk" might still be the Google map API. Although this is already a stretch feature we were still very hopeful in implementing this feature.
