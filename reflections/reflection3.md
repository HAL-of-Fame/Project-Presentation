## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

  We finished everything we planned for our sprints. The cart and order are now working and posts and comments work under their corresponding genre forum. 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

  Connecting the movie API with our backend API was challenging as well as switching over to Material UI which introduced a lot of bugs in our system. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We finished all of our tasks for this sprint and worked a little bit on next week's sprint.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Stackoverflow, React documentation, Material-UI documentation, TA's 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

It's unlikely we'll be adding Google Maps API.
