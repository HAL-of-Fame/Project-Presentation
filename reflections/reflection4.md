## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We worked a lot on the overall Styling of the website and improving the User Experience. We were also able to deploy our website on Heroku and Surge. Additionally, we improved the forum functionality of our website giving users the option to edits and delete their posts. As well as delete their comments. 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 One of the big challenges that we ran into this week would be bugs with the orders part of the website when it is deployed. On our local servers the orders functionality works as intended, but on Heroku/Surge we encounter strange bugs. We also had a number of issues with React states and making the new data from our backend work the way we wanted it to. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We finished a number of tasks for the sprint as they were styling based and related to the functionality of the website. However, we did have some challenges, but we believe that we will be able to complete them by next week!

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 The resources that were very helpful would be the CodePath Deployment Guide as well as our wonderful TAs outside resources such as Stack Overflow and YouTube

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

None :)
