## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 One successful thing we did this week was finish all of our planned goals for sprint one, giving us enough time to start on additional sprints. Additionally, we had time to complete numerous stretch features like the sidebar and the trailer.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Some challenges our group faced were merge conflicts and CSS. Since this was our first time using GitHub we are still getting the hang of putting all our commits together but all the weeks go on we plan to make this process a lot smoother. Additionally, we had some trouble incorporating the week 1 and week 3 search bar functionality to our site but soon found the necessary tools to succeed.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yes, we finished all of the tasks for our sprint this week! We plan to continue this trend for the future weeks!

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Yes we found many of the resources given to us to be helpful as we started this website including, the labs, YouTube, the TA's, our mentors and stackoverflow.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 A feature that we would consider "at risk" would be the Google map API. Although this is already a stretch feature we were still very hopeful in implementing this feature.
